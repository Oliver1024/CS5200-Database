Mini Mart City Park,Our work is rooted in the belief that it is vitally important to create community hubs for local communities to build power and a voice in decisions being made to develop their neighborhoods. We also believe in cultivating joy and creativity. Once fully constructed, MMCP will accomplish the following goals: 1) CLEAN: Installing state of the art remediation technology in a small neighborhood brownfield to clean polluted earth under the park. Once installed, the remediation system will also clean groundwater passing underneath the site. 2) BUILD: A structure where people come together to strengthen their community ties; MMCP will provide free space to nonprofits, and other local groups to help achieve their goals. 3) EDUCATE: A place to learn about art, architecture & healthy urban environments; MMCP will host ongoing education programs, workshops, and lectures. 4) ART: A permanent, accessible cultural center; MMCP will offer exhibitions, performances, and artist residencies.,N,47.544143,-122.319198,6525 Ellis Ave. S
